# Brief 📖

Bard is a restaurant queue manager that helps streamline the waitlist process for both restaurant staff and
customers. With Bard, customers can join a virtual waitlist from anywhere, at any time, without having to physically be in the restaurant. 
They can track their position in the queue and receive notifications when their table is ready.
